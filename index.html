            <p>After more than 17 years in the medical field I decided that it was time this dog learn some new and hip
                tricks.
                I’ve always had a healthy amount of curiosity as to how computers and their interconnectivity work. The
                advent
                of mobile applications did nothing to quench that curiosity, instead adding gasoline to this already
                sizable
                fire.
                For many years I proceeded to deliver patient care as a Registered Nurse while knowing I wanted, even
                needed, a
                change. However I let an atmosphere of complacency fester, keeping me from pursuing my dream. Thankfully
                all the
                hype is true, the brain is indeed a malleable thing, and so is ones pursuit of education! UCF’s web
                developer
                bootcamp presented the opportunity to learn the invaluable skills to get me started on the career path
                of my
                dreams.</p>
            <p>Born in Cuba, I came to the states when I was three years old. Since then I have known nothing but
                Florida as
                home. Although not without a healthy dose of travel, and a couple brief stints In TN and NC. In
                Tennessee I
                stretched my wings as a student for a semester in Collegedale (a real town and not something out of a
                fairytale
                I promise). Unfortunately tuition quickly grounded my wings and I returned to Florida to continue my
                schooling
                in nursing. North Carolina was enjoyed via a travel assignment. After which I did what many South
                Floridians do
                when they decide it’s time to move and try something different. I moved 4 hours north to Central
                Florida. I met
                my wife and married here, it’s now indeed a place I’m proud to call home. Although San Francisco and its
                perpetual 75 degrees yearly temperature does provide a dose of envy. </p>
            <p>As you would have it, life does seem to have its flow in reason. Its yin and yang, or purpose and meaning
                in
                events if you will. With the experience I’ve obtained in the last 17 years, I have developed into
                someone that
                now embraces challenges. The mix of my curiosity in computing and a growing desire to overcome the
                challenges
                coding presents; is something that I know comes in part from those previous life experiences at work. I
                desire
                to succeed, to be challenged, more than ever in life, and I can hardly wait for tech to take me there.
